<h1>
My Thoughts on IntelliJ
</h1>
  <p>
  Prior to my venture into IntelliJ for Javascript, I hadn't really explored IDEs. Getting acquainted with IntelliJ introduced me to the seemingly effortless approach to coding and formatting. However, figuring out how to adjust preferences and reformat code in the settings proved to be a bit bewildering, especially since the window layout was unfamiliar to me. Yet, once I sorted out my preferred settings, I was pleasantly surprised by how straightforward it became to write code. With the help of coding style preferences, I found myself able to write and refine code with greater ease and accuracy.
