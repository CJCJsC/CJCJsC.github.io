<h1>
My Thoughts on IntelliJ
</h1>
  <p>
  Prior to my venture into IntelliJ for Javascript, I hadn't really explored Integrated Development Environments (IDE's). Getting acquainted with IntelliJ introduced me to the seemingly effortless approach to coding and formatting. However, figuring out how to adjust preferences and reformat code in the settings proved to be a bit bewildering, especially since the window layout was unfamiliar to me. Yet, once I sorted out my preferred settings, I was pleasantly surprised by how straightforward it became to write code. With the help of coding style preferences, I found myself able to write and refine code with greater ease and accuracy. I like how well that Github Desktop works with IntelliJ. It's like a smooth transition from coding in IntelliJ to uploading everything onto the Github website.

<h1>
The Importance of Coding Standards
</h1>
  <p>
  I have come to appreciate the significance of maintaining a clean coding style, a realization nurtured by my prior experiences in coding classes. Prior to taking a JavaScript course, I took a class in C and C++. My instructors consistently reminded us of  the importance of adhering to coding style guidelines and standards, emphasizing their pivotal role in facilitating collaboration within a professional environment. It is imperative not only to comprehend the code being written but also to ensure its clarity and intended functionality. Consequently, when revisiting code at a later juncture, the adherence to established coding standards proves instrumental in promoting readability and comprehension, thereby enhancing the overall quality of the codebase.
