My Thoughts on IntelliJ
</h1>
  <p>
    Before using IntelliJ for Javascript, I never dabbled with IDE's before. While using IntelliJ for the first time has shown me the 'easy way out' of writing and formatting code. However, learning to re-format and to set the preferences in the settings was confusing for me since the window formatting was something I was not accustomed to.
