Notes:

(9)Coding Standards


<p>
  While taking a Software Engineering course, I learned a lot of things relating to Web Development. Not only I learned how to develop website and how to design the websites, I learned some essential things that pretain to web development are, Open Source Software Development, Configuration Management, Functional Programming, Development Environments, Coding Standards, User Interface Frameworks, Agile Project Management, Ethics in Software Engineering, and Design Patterns. Through out this course we were taught these valuable pieces of information that are important to web development. Before starting to code, we were taught the concept of Open Source Software Development, we learned about the multitude of Open Source softwares that are used for coding. Some open source softwares that was in this lesson was the GNU software and Linux. I believe we were taught these because, before we could start coding we had to learn about the basis that allowed people to start coding. Since open source coding is what I imagine when beginners want to start coding.

  Another useful concept that we learned about was Development Environments. In the world of coding a Development Enviornment typically means the type of software you use while coding for a program or project. In this course we used a software called Intellij IDEA, which is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment). There can be a multitude of IDEs but the main purpose of an IDE are, it has easy access to your files allowing to easily code and it is easy to edit any piece of code when it is needed. Another thing that is helpfin for is that it's useful for Debugging Code because of it's ability to easily run the code and execute the code, being able to execute the code from the IDE is useful for ease of use and saves time. Finally, it is good for Project Management since because of its ability to Debug Code, the IDE allows the developer to organize the files, giving them the ease of access to the project files that needs to be completed for the project. Along with an IDE's. This as a whole, is why I think learning about what types of development enviornments are there, and what they can do, is important for programmers to know since it allows them to easily work on developing their projects using their IDE.

  The final piece of knowledge that I think was important to learn from this class was Coding Standards.
