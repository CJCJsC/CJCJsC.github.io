<h2>
I. Introduction: ***
</h2>

<p>
In my Software Engineering course we were encouraged to use AI in order to help us accomplish out work assignments. For some context, AI stands for Artifical Intelligence, a tool that people uses to assist them in completing a project or assignment. A tool that lets people ask a question, and allows that person to get an answer, an answer for any type of question. Some popular websites that has these types of AI are website like, ChatGPT, MicrosoftCoPilot, etc. ... ...

II. Personal Experience with AI:
</h2>

<p>
For the assignments given in my Software Engineering class, I used a lot of AI to assit me in my work. Some examples of me using AI was asking questions like "Give me code that accomplishes this," and would be followed by the Tasks / Problems that needs to be solved, however this example I only use for certain code that can be easily accomplished normally because the given code from AI could have errors, this is why I usually ask questions like the following. I would ask the AI, "Give me examples of code using .map in Java" and I would apply the example that the AI gives me into my code. Other types of things I would ask the AI are questions that pretain to coding errors, for example I would give the AI my code, the error line that was given, and ask how to fix it, and then apply it to my code afterwards. I like asking the AI questions like these because I feel like I am still learning, I don't wanna keep asking the AI for answers, I want to still be able to learn while asking questions. Besides using AI for coding, I also got help from AI for essays that I would need to write for the course. However, using AI to completly write out an essay for you would be very ill advised because why would you write an essay when it has none of your 'essence' in it? When I ask for the AI for help, I only ask questions like, "Are there any grammatical errors within this essay?" or "Are there any spelling errors within this essay?", followed by the essay that I wrote. I like using AI for this because, sometimes the program that I use to write essays don't have a built in grammar or spell checking system.

III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:
</h2>

<p>
In ways that using AI could improve or weaken things like the your comprehension, development of skills in the respective subject , and problem-solving abilities. Some ways that AI could reduce your problem-solving skills are by just using AI to cheat. Asking AI to completely solve a problem by itself is similar to the act of cheating. Cheating doesn't allow the user to learn by themselves and to improve their own skillset. Similarly to using AI to solve a problem, it doesn't allow the user to learn by themselves, since the Ai is doing all the work, and the user doesn't improve upon himself and not enhance his problem-skills. Some ways that AI could improve your skill development, are using AI for things like asking the AI for corrections for the errors, and asking them how to use a certain coding method. Using AI for this purpose, gives the user more examples to learn from and they could apply it to their work. For the error example, asking the AI to correct their code, can make the user learn from their mistakes and they won't make it again. Other ways that AI could enhance your learning is by asking them for different ways to accomplish your project, not exactly asking them to complete it but to give examples of more diverse ways of accomplishing the user's project. This way the user can learn more methods and potentionally learn more.

IV. Practical Applications:
</h2>

<p>
  
To my knowledge, I know several examples of AI being used in a multitude of projects, for example projects like Games and Machine Learning. There are a lot of videos online showcasing a content creator creating an MLA (Machine Learning Algorithm), similar to AI, in which they would be tasked to complete a certain objective. For example, a [youtuber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmQ4Dqxs0HI) re-creating a game in code, and creating an AI to beat the game, and seeing how well they would do while adjusting certain parameters and achivements that the AI has to follow and complete. Also, there is another [youtuber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJPdW8WWAso) that creates a MLA that makes a 3d charatcer model and tasks them to walk. I think these two projects are realy interesting and allows people to see the progress of AI and sees how well they need to evolve, inorder to accomplish a task. I think these examples show how effective a MLA is when needing to accomplish a simple and easy task. With enough time, a MLA can easily learn how to accomplish a task, given that the task has minimal requirments and that it is easy to implement. A real world example involving real work involves this [MLA scanner](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-pastry-ai-that-learned-to-fight-cancer) that was used for scanning bread to calculate the cost of the total purchase. This was soon re-purposed for identifying cancer cells, because of it's value of identifying, different shapes and sizes, and comparing them to each other.

<h2>
V. Challenges and Opportunities: ***
</h2>

<p>
Some challenges that arrive when using AI are, using any work or code that is given by AI will eventually give you errors later on. Working on an assignment that is strictly only being coded by an AI is very risky and not healthy for the worker, the consumer, and the project as a whole. Using code that is given and written by AI is a very big mistake in which you could have unforseen errors hidden within the code, some examples include, errors with can contradict or interfers with other files, if the code needs to be changed the user who copied the code will have trouble updating the code because he wasn't the one who wrote the code, so they will have a hard time understanding what parts of the code they will need to change. However some opportunities that arrive when using AI are, saving time on work, using MLA to accomplish a task, and asking the AI on fixes on errors in the code. I believe these three ways are good opportunities to allow AI to be used while working on a project. Asking an AI to format a template for your project helps time without formatting it yourself. Having the AI do this easily saves enough time for the user to think of aspects for the project, like what to use for methods and functions. Using MLA to accomplish a task is a good example from the last section, having an AI to do this job for the user easily saves more time in the long run, and can be reused in a different area of used correctly. Another way that AI is used good for is to fix errors since sometimes bug fixing code can be hard when you don't recognize the error line.
