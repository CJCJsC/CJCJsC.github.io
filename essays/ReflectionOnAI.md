<h2>
I. Introduction: ***
</h2>

<p>
In my Software Engineering course we were encouraged to use AI in order to help us accomplish out work assignments. For some context, AI stands for Artifical Intelligence, a tool that people uses to assist them in completing a project or assignment. A tool that lets people ask a question, and allows that person to get an answer, an answer for any type of question. Some popular websites that has these types of AI are website like, ChatGPT, MicrosoftCoPilot, etc. ... ...

II. Personal Experience with AI:
</h2>

<p>
For the assignments given in my Software Engineering class, I used a lot of AI to assit me in my work. Some examples of me using AI was asking questions like "Give me code that accomplishes this," and would be followed by the Tasks / Problems that needs to be solved, however this example I only use for certain code that can be easily accomplished normally because the given code from AI could have errors, this is why I usually ask questions like the following. I would ask the AI, "Give me examples of code using .map in Java" and I would apply the example that the AI gives me into my code. Other types of things I would ask the AI are questions that pretain to coding errors, for example I would give the AI my code, the error line that was given, and ask how to fix it, and then apply it to my code afterwards. I like asking the AI questions like these because I feel like I am still learning, I don't wanna keep asking the AI for answers, I want to still be able to learn while asking questions.Besides using AI for coding, I also got help from AI for essays that I would need to write for the course. However, using AI to completly write out an essay for you would be very ill advised because why would you write an essay when it has none of your 'essence' in it? When I ask for the AI for help, I only ask questions like, "Are there any grammatical errors within this essay?" or "Are there any spelling errors within this essay?", followed by the essay that I wrote. I like using AI for this because, sometimes the program that I use to write essays don't have a built in grammar or spell checking system.

III. Impact on Learning and Understanding: ***
</h2>

<p>
I feel like depending on how you use AI, it could either dampen your learning and understanding or, it could enhance your learning experience. In the given examples in the previous paragraph, when asking the AI for corrections for the errors, and asking them how to use a certain coding method. These type of questions

V. Challenges and Opportunities:

<p>
Some challenges that arrive when using AI are, when using any work or code that is given by AI will eventually give you errors later on.

However some opportunities that arrive when using AI are, saving time on work, ...
