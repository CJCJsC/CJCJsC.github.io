<h2>I. Introduction:</h2>

<p>
  In my Software Engineering course, AI emerged as a valuable resource to aid us in completing our work assignments. AI, short for Artificial Intelligence, serves as a versatile tool enabling individuals to seek assistance in various tasks. It allows users to pose questions and receive answers across a wide range of topics. Notable AI platforms like ChatGPT and MicrosoftCoPilot exemplify this capability. Throughout the course, we explored the multifaceted applications of AI, leveraging its potential to streamline tasks, provide insights, and enhance problem-solving. This introduction sets the stage for delving deeper into the challenges, opportunities, and considerations surrounding the integration of AI in our coursework and beyond.
<p>

<h2>II. Personal Experience with AI:</h2>

<p>
    In my Software Engineering class assignments, I extensively utilized AI to aid my work. For instance, I often sought assistance by asking questions such as, "Could you provide code that accomplishes this task?" This method, however, was reserved for relatively straightforward tasks, as AI-generated code may contain errors. Thus, I exercised caution and typically supplemented such examples with inquiries like, "Can you offer examples of code using .map in Java?" These examples served as valuable references for integrating AI-generated solutions into my projects. Additionally, I frequently consulted AI for debugging assistance. By presenting my code along with the error message, I could promptly receive guidance on rectifying issues, enabling me to refine my coding skills while utilizing AI as a learning aid. Beyond coding, I also leveraged AI for essay writing tasks in the course. However, I refrained from relying solely on AI to compose entire essays, as it would undermine the essence of personal expression. Instead, I utilized AI to identify and correct grammatical or spelling errors in my drafts, ensuring a polished final product. This approach proved beneficial, particularly when the writing software lacked robust grammar and spell-checking capabilities.

<h2>III. Impact on Learning and Understanding:</h2>

<p>
    Using AI can either enhance or diminish comprehension, skill development in respective subjects, and problem-solving abilities. One way AI could weaken problem-solving skills is by relying on it as a shortcut, akin to cheating. Depending solely on AI to solve problems deprives users of the chance to learn independently and improve their own skill sets. Similarly, when AI solves problems entirely, users miss out on the opportunity to develop their problem-solving skills as the AI performs all the work, hindering personal growth. Conversely, AI can aid skill development by providing error corrections and guidance on coding methods. Seeking AI assistance for error corrections and coding methods offers users additional examples to learn from and apply to their work. For example, requesting AI assistance in error correction allows users to learn from their mistakes, reducing the likelihood of repeating them. Furthermore, AI can enhance learning by suggesting alternative approaches to problem-solving without solving the problem outright. Instead of asking AI to complete a task, users can request examples of diverse methods for accomplishing their projects. This approach encourages exploration and deepens understanding of various problem-solving strategies, enabling users to expand their skill sets.

<h2>IV. Practical Applications:</h2>

<p>
  
  I'm aware of several examples of AI being utilized in various projects, including games and machine learning. Online videos often demonstrate content creators developing Machine Learning Algorithms (MLAs) to achieve specific objectives. For instance, a [YouTuber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmQ4Dqxs0HI) recreated a game in code and design an AI to play and succeed in the game while adjusting parameters and achievements for the AI. Another example involves a [YouTuber](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJPdW8WWAso) creating an MLA that generates a 3D character model and instructs it to walk. These projects are intriguing as they illustrate the progression of AI and highlight the need for continuous evolution to accomplish tasks effectively. They demonstrate the effectiveness of MLAs in tackling simple tasks given sufficient time, minimal requirements, and ease of implementation. A real-world application of AI in practical work involves an MLA scanner that was initially developed for scanning bread to calculate purchase costs. However, it was later repurposed for identifying cancer cells due to its capability in recognizing different shapes and sizes and comparing them. You can find more about it in this [New Yorker article](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/the-pastry-ai-that-learned-to-fight-cancer).

<h2>Challenges and Opportunities:</h2>

<p>
  Some challenges that arise when using AI include using any work or code provided by AI, which may eventually lead to errors. Relying solely on AI to complete an assignment is risky and detrimental to the worker, the consumer, and the project as a whole. Employing code generated by AI is a significant mistake, as it may contain unforeseen errors. Examples include errors that contradict or interfere with other files. If the code needs to be changed, users who have copied the code may struggle to update it since they did not write the code themselves. However, there are opportunities when using AI. These include saving time on work, leveraging MLAs to accomplish tasks, and seeking AI assistance in error correction. These avenues offer efficient ways to incorporate AI into projects. For instance, requesting AI to format a project template saves time that would otherwise be spent on manual formatting, allowing users to focus on other aspects of the project, such as selecting methods and functions. Similarly, employing MLAs to accomplish tasks, as mentioned in the previous section, saves time in the long run and can be repurposed for different areas if used correctly. Additionally, utilizing AI to fix errors is beneficial, especially when debugging code can be challenging without recognizing the error line.

<h2>VI. Comparative Analysis:</h2>

<p>
  Comparing the teaching methods of a standard face-to-face teacher and an AI, the standard teacher is by far more advanced, especially in coding contexts. When consulting a professor or senior regarding coding, they provide a multitude of examples and various approaches to problem-solving. In contrast, AI typically offers a singular approach, deducing it as the best method for the task. While AI may provide efficient solutions, learning from a professor offers more diverse examples and guides learners through the coding process with different methods. Overall, engagement levels are higher with a professor, as questioning is more thoughtful. Knowledge retention is also higher with a professor, as mental notes tend to be more effective than merely copying and pasting code provided by AI without understanding its implications. Additionally, learning under a teacher allows for more hands-on practice, fostering skill development in coding.
</p>


<h2>VII. Future Considerations:</h2>

<p>
  When utilizing Artificial Intelligence, several factors merit consideration. Firstly, we must explore the various ways to integrate AI into our work and daily lives, leveraging its capabilities to streamline tasks and enhance efficiency. Additionally, we should explore how AI can aid in self-education and teaching others. For those contemplating future AI use, it's advisable not to rely solely on AI when learning something new. Instead, individuals should conduct their own research through articles, online courses, or instructional videos. AI should serve as a supplementary resource, particularly when learning coding methodologies. Furthermore, it's essential to recognize areas where AI requires improvement. AI systems may not always be up-to-date with the latest information, as their knowledge is limited by their creators. For instance, ChatGPT's knowledge is current only up to January 2022. Thus, if developments occur in coding or related fields after this period, AI may lack updated information.
</p>


<h2>VIII. Conclusion:</h2>

<p>
  Is AI a useful tool? Yes, undoubtedly, AI proves beneficial for specific tasks within work environments. However, relying solely on AI for entire projects offers limited benefits. AI should augment human efforts, not replace them entirely. Reflecting on my own experience with AI, I initially found it helpful in this course. Yet, I realized it wasn't facilitating true learning; it was merely aiding in completing tasks. Over time, I adapted my approach to using ChatGPT's AI to my advantage, focusing on learning rather than simply copying and pasting code. In the realm of coding, AI should be utilized primarily for creating templates, error correction, providing additional examples, and serving as a last resort when encountering unfamiliar concepts.
