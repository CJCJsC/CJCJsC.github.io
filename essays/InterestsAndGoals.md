<h1>Why did I choose Software Engineering</h1>

<p>
  I chose software engineering because I have always been interested in anything related to technology. I was exposed to many aspects during my upbringing, including Gaming Development, Web Development, Robots, AI, etc. When I was younger, I often wondered about how things like computers, apps, programs, and websites worked. Thinking of these things always piqued my interest and made me want to delve deeper into the virtual world of Software Engineering. I also have personal reasons; I enjoy playing games as a hobby, prefer staying at home, and appreciate the prospect of making money. Also, I envisioned to myself if I could create these things I saw on the internet but with my own style and flair. So, starting in middle school, I slowly began teaching myself anything related to software, and when high school came around, I delved more in-depth into it. Sadly, I haven't created anything significant for myself, but I hope to eventually spend my free time making something that I can be proud of.

<h1>What skills do I want to learn?</h1>

<p>
  I aspire to develop skills that encompass both game and web development. In the future, I aim to create both a game and a corresponding website, yet I currently possess limited knowledge and skills in these areas. My plans are abundant, but my expertise is lacking. I desire to acquire skills that I can seamlessly integrate into my projects, whether it be developing a 2D, 3D, or Text-Based game, or crafting programs to streamline my daily life. Additionally, I seek skills that enable me to create entertaining programs for my family and friends. My goal is to gradually acquire these skills and accumulate experience, advancing along the path of software engineering.
