<h1>
Why did I choose Software Engineering
</h1>

I choose software engineering because I was always interesting in anything related to technology. I was exposed to many of the following when I was growing up, Gaming Development, Web Development, Robots, AI, etc. When I was younger I always wondered how things would work and things like computers, apps, programs, websites. I thought to myself if I could make these things that I saw on the internet, but with my own style and flair. So, starting in Middle school I slowly started teaching myself anything software related, and when Highschool came around I dived more indepth with it. Sadly I haven't made any thing big for myself, but I hope I can eventually spend my free time making something that I can be proud of. 

I also have personal reasons, I like playing games as a hobby, I like staying home, and I like making money.


<h1>
What skills do I want to learn?
</h1>

I want to develop skills that cater to both game and web development. Since in the futue I want to develop a game and a website that can be paired up with the game, I have a lot of plans however very little skill and knowledge about how to develop both of them. I wish to learn these skills and hopefully slowly gain experience further in the future, in which I follow this path of software engineering.
