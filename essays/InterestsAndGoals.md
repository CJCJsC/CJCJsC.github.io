<h1>
Why did I choose Software Engineering
</h1>

I chose software engineering because I have always been interested in anything related to technology. I was exposed to many aspects during my upbringing, including Gaming Development, Web Development, Robots, AI, etc. When I was younger, I often wondered about how things like computers, apps, programs, and websites worked, thinking of these things always peaked my interest and made me went to delve in deeper, to dive into the virtual world of Software Engineering. I also have personal reasons; I enjoy playing games as a hobby, prefer staying at home, and appreciate the prospect of making money. Also, I envisioned to my self if could create these things I saw on the internet but with my own style and flair. So, starting in middle school, I slowly began teaching myself anything related to software, and when high school came around, I delved more in-depth into it. Sadly, I haven't created anything significant for myself, but I hope to eventually spend my free time making something that I can be proud of.


<h1>
What skills do I want to learn?
</h1>

I want to develop skills that cater to both game and web development. Since, in the future, I plan to develop a game and a website that can be paired up with the game, I have many plans but very little skill and knowledge about how to develop both of them. The type of skills that I want to learn are ones that allow me to incorporate them into my projects, like if I wanted to create a 2D game, or a 3D game, or a Text-Based game, or skills that allow me to create programs for myself that can make my day to day life easier, or skills that allow me to create funny programs to make my family and friends laugh. I wish to learn these skills and, hopefully, slowly gain experience in the future, following the path of software engineering.
