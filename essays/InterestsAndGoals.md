<p>
  My choice to pursue software engineering stems from a lifelong fascination with technology. From a young age, I was exposed to various facets of it, spanning from Gaming Development to Web Development, Robots, and AI. I often found myself pondering the inner workings of computers, apps, programs, and websites, which ignited a curiosity leading me into the realm of Software Engineering.Beyond mere intrigue, I have personal motivations driving me towards this field. Gaming has always been a beloved hobby of mine, and the idea of crafting virtual worlds excites me. Additionally, I find solace in the comfort of home and see the potential for financial stability in software engineering.Moreover, I have a vision of putting my own spin on the creations I encounter online. Starting in middle school, I took it upon myself to learn as much as I could about software, and as high school approached, I delved even deeper into the subject. Though I haven't yet produced anything significant, I aspire to dedicate my free time to crafting projects of which I can be truly proud.
