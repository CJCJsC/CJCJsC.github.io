<h1>
The Smart Questions
</h1>

After reading 'How To Ask Questions The Smart Way' by Eric Steven Raymond, I realized that asking questions wasn't as simple as I first thought.

The contents of the question has to be abundant but also, not overloaded. It had to be precise but not too generalized. It had to be explicit, not obscure. It had to be something that couldn't be done with a simple 'Google Search'. Also, the question needs to have appropriate grammar inorder for the reader to understnad the question. The previous requirements matches both of these questions perfectly. [What is a NullPointerException, and how do I fix it](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/218384/what-is-a-nullpointerexception-and-how-do-i-fix-it) and [What and where are the stack and heap?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79923/what-and-where-are-the-stack-and-heap). 

The first question is simply about the NullPointerException Error and how to fix them. The developer that asked this question even goes more indepth and asks how the problem occurs, as well as if there was any methods to stop this from happening. This question has a simple header that grasps people's attention and then delves into more topics that relates to the header.The second question is about the Stack and the Heap. The header asks about 'what' and 'where' they are, but asks more questions afterwards, the questions being: Where they are physically in a computer's memeory, What determines their sizes, What makes one faster, etc. This question was also simple but, it spitballs even more simple and quick questions that can be explained further upon by the person who is going to explain the answer to them. Allowing the explainer to have a thoughful explaination about the topic.

Taking the essence of these questions are very important for software engineers. Using the way how these questions were asked are useful in a sense that you are learning from the question, as well as helping others understand as well. It allows for the questioner, to thoughtfully ask their question while the listener can easily understand the question and respond back with an appropriate answer.

The Not So Smart Questions
</h1>

On the otherhand, this question about [Looking for a photo rating script](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77884121/looking-for-photo-rating-script-like-hotornot), is not like the previously mentioned questions. This question was asked because the developer wanted a coding script that allowed the user to rate a photo. There is nothing wrong with the question, its just the questioner won't grow as a software engineer with by asking in this type of way. This question was asked by a developer who isn't asking a question to get an explaination and to learn from it, they are simply looking for a direct answer. This isn't a good method to follow as a software engineer since, yes getting answers is great, the reason to asks 'Smart' questions is to learn from the question not to just get the answer. It's similar to the saying, 'its not about the journey but the destination'.
