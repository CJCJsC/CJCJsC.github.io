<h1>
My Thoughts on Bootstrap
</h1>
<p>
I have worked with HTML and JavaScript before; however, in those courses, I wasn't taught what 'UI Frameworks' were or how to use Bootstrap 5. In this Software Engineering class, learning JavaScript, HTML, and CSS was interesting for me because it gives me the opportunity to create my own website. When I was tasked to 'Re-Create' a website as a given assignment in this class, using the classes from Bootstrap was very frustrating because I had trouble incorporating the code into my work. I wasn't used to how Bootstrap worked as a framework. However, after going through the practice problems given in this course, I found it very helpful to learn. Some of the classes that I really liked were the 'row', 'col', and 'navbar' classes since these three classes are the basis of any website. Additionally, the extra classes that Bootstrap provides, like the ability to change colors, add padding around the 'div' or 'section', and easily incorporate icons, were very helpful. Bootstrap is very useful as a framework because it allows the developer to be very creative with their website design, with easy and accessible code.

After this lesson on UI Frameworks, I don't think I could ever make another website without using Bootstrap.
