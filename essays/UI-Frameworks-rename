<h1>
My Thoughts on Bootstrap
</h1>
<p>
I have worked with HTML and Javascript before however, in those courses I wasn't taught  what 'UI Frameworks' was or how to use Bootstrap 5. In this Software Engineering class, learning Javascript, HTML and CSS was interesting for me to learn since it gives me the opportunity to create my own website. When I was tasked to 'Re-Create' website as a given assignment in this class, using the classes from Bootstrap was very frustrating because I had trouble incorpoarting the code into my work because I wasn't used to how Bootstrap worked as a Framework, however, after going through the given practice problems in this course was very helpful for me to learn.. Some of the classes that I really liked was the 'row' , 'col', 'navbar' classes since these three classes are the basis of any website. As well as the extra given classes that Bootstrap provides like being able to change colors, put padding around the 'div' or 'section' as well as having a website just to add icons. Bootstrap is very useful as a framework since it allows the developer to be very creative with their website and it allows them to freely design the website, with easy and accessible code.

After this lesson on UI Frameworks, I don't think I could ever make another website without using Bootstrap.
