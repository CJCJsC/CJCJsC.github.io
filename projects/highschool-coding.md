This website was made by me during my highschool years, this project was made overtime with coding assignments being slowly added through out the class. This class was my first coding class outside of teaching myself coding through videos and google.

This class was mainly about learning HTML, however we gradually learned Python, CSS, and Javascript. This class helped me learn the basics of these coding languages. That place was also a great way to learn because the teacher there was very social and open with coding. The students were very helpful and were excited about learning in the class.

However because of this class I learned the aspects of how a coding class goes. Its work schedule and short time constraints, it was something that I quickly learned at the beginning of taking the course. I also learned how fun it is to learn coding and to incroporate it into other projects, since its a time save that some people would look over.
