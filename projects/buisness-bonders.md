<h1>Business Bonder</h1>
<p>

The name [_Buisness Bonder_](https://businessbonders.xyz/), is the name of the company that created a website called the Company Connector. The Company Connector is a website that allows for students and companys to create a profile for themselves, put it into the database, and allows for the students and the companys to connect or bond with each other.
</p>

<p>
  
The purpose of this website is to allow students to have the opportunity to be a part of internships or have a chance to be hired as an employee for a job, instead of waiting for a company to visit the class or school. This website is also a good way for companies to get employees since instead of visit the school to look for students willing to work or apply for an internship, they can just make a profile on the website and have the students come to them instead of the company going to the students. This saves a lot of time and they don't need to waste time or resources presenting their company to a class of students who aren't interested in their specific work. This website allows for students and companies to easily connect to each other based of the interests of the student, and the needs or jobs of the company.
