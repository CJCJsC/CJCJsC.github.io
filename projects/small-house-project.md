<h1>
  Small House Project
</h1>

This project was made with the me and two other students taking the class called Design Tech.

This project was made for a contest called '[Tiny House Design Challenge](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mKz_WZUaSj4p2j4a9ONK0spFB6TJvteG/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=101069725802984305522&rtpof=true&sd=true)'. It was a contest to make a house with the floor plan size of 500 square feet, and to have the materials for the house be under 100,000 dollars in cost.

We had to make the blueprint, floor plan, calculate the theortical cost of all the materials for the house, furnish the house, figure out the wiring and plumbing, and to create a small scale building of the house we were making.

This project was really fun to work on and it was very fun using AutoCAD to make the floor plan as well as building up each wall and roof for the house. This project also taught me many things like the other projects, this taught me the coordination you need with your team mates. We split up the work between the three of us, one person worked on calculating the cost of the house as well as researching how the house should be developed and worked on creating a social media account, the other person worked on both the second floor's floor plan and roof along with building them. I worked on the first floor's floor plan, and I worked on the wiring for the house. For everything that happened during the making of this project, learning how to manage the work between people was difficult because we had to split it up by what they can do, as well as to coordinate when we needed to finish certain areas of the project. This project let me learn the value of team work and the value of time management.
