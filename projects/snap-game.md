<h1>
  Game Final Project
</h1>

If you don't know what Snap is, it is similar to scratch in where the code isn't 'typed' but used in building blocks, and can uniformly connect to other blocks to replicate code.

This game is about playing as a person that is walking through the park avoiding to catch the disease 'Covid'.

There are two mini games within this program, you can switch freely between the two games by pressing 1 or 2 on your keyboard.

Game 1: you use the the left and right arrow keys to avoid 'Covid' to gain points, if you get hit it's game over.

Game 2: you collect toilet paper rolls to gain points, you must avoid the other person ,that walks through walls, if not it's a game over.

I made this game as a final project in ICS 103, I took it during one of my summers, after my junior year in highschool. This class was fun because the type of assignments was fun coding programs that allowed us to learn and to use our creativity to complete the assignment.

This final project was fun for me since I always wanted to create a game and have fun playing it. However this final project taught me a valuable lesson, which is having a time constraint for a project doesn't allow for me as a developer to fully incorporate all my ideas into the game. At first I wanted to add seperate games that the player can choose from and play them, sadly I couldn't figure out a way to make a menu. Also, I couldn't finish the second game because of the bugs I kept running into. You can see the seperate code by looking at the Sprites at the bottom. This was a great lesson for me, I learned to spend my time wisely and to know my limits when wanted to incorporate code for a game.
