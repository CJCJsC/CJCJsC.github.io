<h1>
  Game Final Project
</h1>


If you're unfamiliar with Snap, it's similar to Scratch, where code isn't 'typed' but constructed using building blocks that can be interconnected to replicate code.

The game revolves around controlling a character walking through a park while avoiding catching the virus 'Covid'.

There are two mini-games within this program, and you can freely switch between them by pressing 1 or 2 on your keyboard.

In Game 1, you use the left and right arrow keys to avoid 'Covid' and earn points. Getting hit results in game over.

In Game 2, you collect toilet paper rolls to gain points. However, you must also evade another character who can walk through walls; failing to do so results in game over.

I created this game, [Isolation Experience](https://snap.berkeley.edu/snap/snap.html#present:Username=cj%20caraang&ProjectName=Final%20Project%2C%20Isolation%20Experience), as the final project for my ICS 103 course, which I took during one of my summer breaks after my junior year in high school. This class was particularly enjoyable because the assignments involved coding programs that allowed us to learn and exercise our creativity.

Developing this final project was a blast for me as I've always wanted to create and play games. However, it also taught me a valuable lesson about time constraints. I realized that when there's a deadline, I can't incorporate all of my ideas into the game as I would have liked. Initially, I wanted to include multiple games that players could choose from, but I struggled to implement a menu system. Additionally, I encountered numerous bugs while working on the second game, which prevented me from completing it.

You can observe the separate code for each game by examining the sprites at the bottom. This experience taught me to use my time wisely and recognize my limitations when it comes to coding for a game.
